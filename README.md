## 🎯 Project Overview

This capstone project implements an advanced machine learning-enhanced trading strategy that combines SuperTrend technical indicators with ensemble ML models to predict profitable trading opportunities in volatile markets.

### Business Problem
Develop a systematic trading strategy that can consistently generate positive returns while managing risk through ML-based signal enhancement and dynamic position sizing.

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Alpaca API (real-time and historical market data)
- **Symbols**: SOXL (3x leveraged ETF), SMCI, NVDA, META, TSLA
- **Timeframes**: 1Min, 5Min, 10Min, 15Min, 30Min, 1H, 4H, 1D

- **Target Performance**: +25.37% annual return
- **Risk Management**: 6% stop loss, ML-based position sizing
- **ML Enhancement**: Ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, LSTM)
- **Market Regime Detection**: Adaptive strategy based on volatility and trend strength

## 📊 Strategy Components

### Core Strategy
- **SuperTrend Indicator**: Period 11, Multiplier 3.2 (optimized parameters)
